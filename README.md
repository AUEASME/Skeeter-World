The bacteria *Wolbachia* is the most common reproductive parasite on Earth, a position it claimed through a very simple toxin-antidote system. Through the production of a lethal toxin in an infected male's testes and a matching antidote in an infected female's eggs, infection becomes advantageous and eventually necessary for successful reproduction. Described is a simple online simulation for modeling the emergence and spread of infectious agents like *Wolbachia* in mosquito populations, which is helping to elucidate how such a "chicken vs. egg" system evolved in the first place.
